---------------------------------THE PRESENT INDICATIVE ACTIVE OF THE 1ST CONJUGATION-----------------------------

38. The Four Conjugations.
	Regular verbs in latin are divided into four classes, or conjugations, distinguished from one another by the stem vowel
	before the ending -re of the present infinitive active.

		        	Present Infinitive	Present Stem	Distinguishing Vowel

	1st Conjugation		amāre			amā-		ā
	2nd Conjugation		monēre			monē-		ē
	3rd Conjugation		regere			rege-		e
	4th Conjugation		audīre			audī-		ī


39. The Present Indicative Active of The 1st Conjugation
	
				Singular					Personal Endings
		
		1st Person	amō (I love, am loving, do love)		-ō (I)
		2nd Person	amās (you love, are loving, do love)		-s (you)
		3rd Person	amat (he/she/it loves, is loving, does love)	-t (he, she, it)


				Plural						Personal Endings

		1st Person	amāmus (we love, are loving, do love)		-mus (we)
		2nd Person	amātis (you love, are loving, do love)		-tis (you)
		3rd Person	amant (they love, are loving, do love)		-nt (they)

	a. Observe that in amō the final a of the stem disappears, giving amō instead of amaō.
	   In what forms is this a of the stem not long? (refer to 13)

	   - when it precedes another vowel or an h  -- is this why the a (a vowel) disappeared? since an ō (another vowel) followed? --
	   - when it comes before an nt or an nd
	   - wen it comes before a final m or a final t
	
	b. When the subject of a verb is a personal pronoun, it is seldom expressed in Latin unless emphatic. 
	   Why is the omission of the subject possible?
	   
	   - because it can generally be expressed through the personal endings of verbs. In Latin, verb endings can be used to convey
	     person, number etc.
	   
	   Translate Puellās convocātis and Nautam vident.

	   - You (plural) are calling the girls together.
	   - They see the sailor.
