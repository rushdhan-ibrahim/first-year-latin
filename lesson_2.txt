--------THE ACCUSATIVE CASE USED AS THE DIRECT OBJECT---------

32. The Accusative Case used as the Direct Object
		1. Nauta puellam vocat		The sailor calls the girl.
		2. Nautae puellās vocant	The sailors call the girls.
	
	a. Observe that puellam is the object of vocat, and puellās the object of vocant; and that when a Latin noun is used as the         Object, the case ending is not the same as when it is the subject (and so in the nominative).
	
	   The case of the object in Latin is called accusative, and not objective, as in English.
	
	b. Form the accusative singular and plural of the nouns in sections 26 and 34.
		Section 26.
			agricola:	agricolam (sing.)	agricolās (plur.)
			Cornēlia:	Cornēliam		Cornēliās
			Iūlia:		Iūliam			Iūliās
			Nauta:		Nautam			Nautās
			Puella:		Puellam			Puellās

		Section 34.
			Aqua:		Aquam			Aquās
			Galba:		Galbam			Galbās
			Littera:	Litteram		Litterās
			Terra:		Terram			Terrās
			Tuba:		Tubam			Tubās

33. Rule for the Accusative as the Direct Object:
	The object of a verb is in the accusative case.

34.         --------------VOCABULARY----------------

	aqua: water (aquatic)						amat: loves, likes (amateur)
	Galba: Galba							convocat: calls together (convoke)
	littera: letter (of the alphabet);				habet: has, holds (habit) 
		when plural, a letter, epistle (literary)		laudat: praises (laud)
	terra: land (terrace)						videt: sees (provide)
	tuba: trumpet (tuba)						vocat: calls 

	
	quem: accusative of "quis", whom?
	quid: accusative of "quid", what?
	nunc: (adverb), now

35.       -------------ORDER OF WORDS----------------

	Observe that in the model sentences (32) the order of the Latin words is unlike the order of words in the English sentences.
	
	The normal position of the subject of a Latin sentence is at the beginning of the sentence; 
	that of the verb is at the end. Variations from this order put emphasis on the word moved toward the beginning of the sentence;
	thus "puellam nauta vocat" means "the sailor calls a girl". In translating Latin sentences, put the emphasis where it belongs.
