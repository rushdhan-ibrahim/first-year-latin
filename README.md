# First Year Latin: Collar and Daniell

A collection of my notes and solutions to exercises from Collar and Daniell's First Year Latin, as I work through it. This is meant as a growing resource for myself, and for any others who are in the process of learning the language and/or are working through the book themselves.

## Repository Structure

Currently, the repository contains a `.txt` file for each lesson with my notes and solutions. The naming convention for the files is `LessonXX.txt`, where `XX` is the lesson number corresponding to the lessons in the book.

## Future Changes

I might update the organization of the files and change their format as I get further along in the book. Possible changes include:

- Creating topic-based files and organizing them separately, so that jumping around becomes easier if you aren't following the book closely and know what to look for.
- Formatting the `.txt` files to make them more standardized across lessons and more readable, and/or introducing a more structured file format. However, the free-styled `.txt` files remain a personal aesthetic preference for now.
