# first-year-latin
A collection of my notes and solutions to exercises from Collar and Daniell's First Year Latin, as I work through it.
This is meant as growing resource for myself, and for any others who are in the process of learning the language and/or are working through the book themselves.

## Repository Structure

Currently, the repository contains a `.txt` file for each lesson with my notes and solutions. The naming convention for the files is `LessonXX.txt`, where `XX` is the lesson number corresponding to the lessons in the book.

I might update the organization of the files and change their format as I get further along in the book. Possible changes include:

- Creating topic based files and organising them that way separately, so that jumping around becomes easier if you aren't following the book closely and know what to look for.

- Formatting the txt files to make it more standardised across lessons and more readable, and/or introducing a more structured file format, but the free-styled txt files remain a personal aesthetic preference for now.
