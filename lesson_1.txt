27. THE NOMINATIVE CASE USED AS SUBJECT

	1. Puella cantat, the girl sings (is singing, does sing).
	2. Puellae cantant, the girls sing (are singing, do sing).
	3. Cantatne puella, does the girl sing (is the girl singing)?
	4. Cantantne puellae, do the girls sing (are the girls singing)?

	a. In Latin there is no article: puella may be translated girl, a girl, the girl; and puellae girls or the girls.
	b. What is the subject of each of the model sentences and what is the predicate?
		1. Subject: puella	Predicate: cantat
		2. Subject: puellae	Predicate: cantant
		3. Subject: puella	Predicate: cantatne
		4. Subject: puellae	Predicate: cantantne
		
	   In what case is the subject of a Latin verb?
	   	Nominative.

	c. Observe that the verbs agree with their subjects in number.
		For example, in 1. Puella and cantat are both in their singular forms, whereas both are in their plural forms in 2.
	
	d. Observe that -ne is not separately translated. Usually it is attatched to the emphatic word in the sentence, and the
	emphasized word is placed first. 
		For example: Cantatne puella -- whereas the order was different in: Puella cantat.
	When an interrogative word is used, -ne is ommited, like in: Quid appropinquat (What approaches?)

28. Rule for the nominative case as Subject:
	The subject of a verb is in the nominative case.

29. Rule for the agreement of the Verb with its Subject:
	A verb agrees with its subject in person and number.
